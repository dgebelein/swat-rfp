## 1. What is Swat?
Swat is a simulation program that can use weather data to calculate the population dynamics of several vegetable fly species.  Currently included are models for:

- cabbage fly (_delia radicans_)
- carrot fly (_psila rosae_  syn _chamaepsila rosae_)
- onion fly (_delia antiqua_)

These flies are among the most important pests in vegetable production. They occur each year in several, sometimes clearly separated, sometimes overlapping generations, so that in the course of a growing year infestation-free phases alternate with phases of high infestation pressure. Intelligent crop protection solutions must take into account this periodicity.

Swat predicts periods at risk and provides cross-sections through the age structure of pest populations for any point in time. Advisory services are thus given more time to disseminate warnings.  It also helps in scheduling labor-intensive crop inspections and defense or control measures, 

When crop monitoring is conducted, the data collected can be integrated and used both to check the quality of the models and to make quantitative infestation forecasts.


## 2. About this repository
In addition to Swat, the program for the for advisory services and vegetable growers, for modelers the repo includes analysis and AI tools to improve the already included models and to develop new Swat-compatible models for additional species.
